Welcome to StrepHit's documentation!
====================================

**StrepHit** is an intelligent reading agent that understands text and translates it into
`Wikidata <https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:Main_Page>`_ statements.

More specifically, it is a Natural Language Processing pipeline that extracts facts
from text and produces Wikidata statements with references. Its final objective is to
enhance the data quality of Wikidata by suggesting references to validate statements.

**StrepHit** was born in January 2016 and is funded by a `Wikimedia Foundation Individual
Engagement Grant <https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Grants:IEG/StrepHit:_Wikidata_Statements_Validation_via_References>`_ (IEG).

This page contains the technical documentation.
